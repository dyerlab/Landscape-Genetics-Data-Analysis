Dr. Rodney Dyer is an Associate Professor and Director of the Center for Environmental Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia, USA.  His research focuses on genetic connectivity and structure and how the environment influences both.  More information on his research can be found at [http://dyerlab.com](http://dyerlab.com).

## Loading Required Libraries {-}

Working with this text requires several libraries that are not installed on a default `R` installation.  I've created a script that will install this stuff for you directly with the following commands:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyerlab/Landscape-Genetics-Data-Analysis/master/library_loader.R"
source_url( url )
```

This will download several packages and open a few browser windows to the download page of STRUCTURE, Circuitscale, and RStudio (Preview) for you to install if you do not already have copies on your machine.
