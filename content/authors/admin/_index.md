I am from Seattle Washington, though I've been sequestered in Richmond Virginia for a job since 2004.  I see RVA as the "Portland of the East Coast" and we've generally enjoyed our time here in the Old Dominion.  My personal interestes include fermenation sciences (beer, wine, cheese, vegitables), computer programming, fly fishing, and generarlly just spending time with my family.  

Professionally, I'm a Full Professor at [Virginia Commonwealth University](https://vcu.edu) currently serving as the Director of the [Center for Environmental Studies](https://ces.vcu.edu).  My research focuses on  understanding how landscape configuration and human mediated alteration influence connectivity amongst native and introduced species of plants and animals.  Here are my [Curriculum Vitae](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B5DopW1PR12KhL3yiWiGf_YZCIXn1b77Er87mxqgShg/edit?usp=sharing) and [Google Scholar Profile](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R75bxRMAAAAJ), [OrcID](http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4707-3453) if you are into that kind of stuff.
