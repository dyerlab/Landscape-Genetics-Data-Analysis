This course examines the methodologies utilized in the pursuit of research self-identifying as landscape genetics—an analysis of how ecological, vegetation, anthropogenic and topographic context influences genetic connectivity and structure in both natural and modified populations.  This topic uses spatio-ecological data analyses to predict genetic characteristics of existing—and even potential structure of future—orgnamsimal populations.  This course is intended to help population geneticists learn landscape ecological approaches that may be impacting current movement, connectivity, and strucgture as well as spatial ecologists who know little about population genetic  structure and microevolutionary processes.  

You **must** have a seasoned background in R for this course.

## Learning Objectives

To ecologists, a gene is a gene and we just need to find the one that does {insert random phenotypic trait here}.  To population geneticists, the landscape has no heterogeity, so we can consider all populations as equally reachable.  While these individual assumptions may lead to some wonderful simplifying assumptions in our underlying mathematica models, they really have no more basis in reality than the assumptions in our undergraduate physics class about the cow being a perfect sphere...

And while we all like to simplify our models, we are *actually* scientists and must embace the complexity of the ecologic-spatio-genetic systems we work with.  Get over it, pull up your big person pants, and lets get to work.

In this course you are going to learn examine the *Fundamental Landscape Genetic* equation.

$$G \approx f(S,H,E)$$

where the left side of this equation ($G$) represents the spatial distribution and covariance in population genetic structure, which is defined by a complex function of $S$patial, $H$istorical, and $E$cological predictor variables.  To do this, you must learn how to:

- Harvest and work with geospatial data in the form of {{<hl>}}rasters{{</hl>}}, {{<hl>}}points{{</hl>}}, {{<hl>}}lines{{</hl>}}, and {{<hl>}}polygons{{</hl>}}.
- Understand that all of the spatial and ecolgical variables may be represented by their own unique scale, intensity, and granulariy on the landscape.
- Be able to harvest both {{<hl>}}distance{{</hl>}} and {{<hl>}}covariance structures{{</hl>}} from genetic data: markers, SNPs, RFLPs, Allozymes, ... (whatever really, it makes no difference to this course, you'll use the markers you have access to and that are best suited to your own system and question).
- Decide which set of {{<hl>}}statistical approaches{{</hl>}} are most appropriate to examine at-site, around-site, and between-site influences on genetic structure and connectivity.
- Be able to present results in a way that {{<hl>}}does not suck{{</hl>}}.
