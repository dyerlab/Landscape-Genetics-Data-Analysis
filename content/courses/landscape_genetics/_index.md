## Overview

This course requires you to have a working knowledge of `R` *prior* to starting this class.  Since this is an digital course, I will provide some background materials so that I can assume that everyone is on the exact same page when we start the class.  I am more than happy to help troubleshoot and assist you in preprationsâ€”if you need help, please reach out.
