## Learning Objectives


The content presented herein is intended to be viewed **before** the start of the course, so that you are able to:

- Download and have the latest versions of {{<hl>}}R{{</hl>}}, {{<hl>}}RStudio{{</hl>}}, and {{<hl>}}packages{{</hl>}} used in this class.  
- Be comfortable working with {{<hl>}}RMarkdown{{</hl>}} as a medium for bringing togehter your data, analyses, and code.  
- Have a *minimal* aptitude using the constellation of libraries in {{<hl>}}tidyverse{{</hl>}}.
- Be able to load data from {{<hl>}}GitHub{{</hl>}} in R (either packages or data sets).

## Overview

This course requires you to have a working knowledge of `R` *prior* to starting this class.  Since this is an digital course, I will provide some background materials so that I can assume that everyone is on the exact same page when we start the class.  I am more than happy to help troubleshoot and assist you in preprationsâ€”if you need help, please reach out.

## FAQs

Here are some common questions I get before this class.

{{< spoiler text="What do I need to know *a priori*?" >}}
The following requirements pertain to students in this course:  
- You must have you own computer that is capable of running [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com).  
- You must already know some `R`.  It is not going to be in your best interests to come to this class thinking (well, I'm a smart academic, I can just learn `R` and `sample( c("Population Genetics","GIS","Landscape Ecology"), size=2)` at the same time (n.b., if you don't understand this sentence, perhaps you need not be in this class).

{{< spoiler text="Is there time to work on/ask questions about my own data?" >}}
Absolutely! I am more than happy to provide personal time to you and your research project/questions *after* the course is completed.  In addition to online interactions, in the past I've also hosted individuals from this course in my own laboratory as a visiting scholar (back when we could travel) and would be happy to do so in the future if this helps out with your own reserach progam/project.

{{< spoiler text="What packages do I need to install?" >}}
The week before the class starts, I will send out *detailed* instructions to you on how to configure your [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.org) setup to be able to handle all the components in this class.  The exercises and activities in this workshop are all based upon the most recent version of the latest packages because all lectures and activities are actively knit right before the class starts.
